function [value,isterminal,direction] = event_function(T,X)

% need this for the bob file for Compost Bomb code

% when value is equal to zero, an event is triggered.
% set terminal to 1 to stop the solver at the first event, or 0 to
% get all the events.
%  direction=0 if all zeros are to be computed (the default), +1 if
%  only zeros where the event function is increasing, and -1 if only
%  zeros where the event function is decreasing.
value = X(:,1) - 100;  % when value = 0, an event is triggered
isterminal = 1; % terminate after the first event
direction = 0;  % get all the zeros
